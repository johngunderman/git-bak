git-bak
=======

git-bak is a simple backup solution based on git. 

However, unlike git repositories, the repo can be located at any user specified location, not just the tracked repository.

At the moment, the only supported features are the creation of a git-bak repo and manual backups. restoring from a git-bak repo is partially up, It works if we are restoring into a blank directory, not if we are reverting to a previous version. However, git-bak supports all git commands.


TODO list:

* Interactive prompt upon setting up git-bak repo.
  This should set up a cronjob for automatic backups,
  and should allow for the user to set up a .gitignore file
  for backups. An automatic rebase operation should also be optional
  (to compress older commits).

* git-bak restore should allow for the user to revert to a previous backup.

* Other features which I have yet to decide on.


Please let me know if you have any suggestions or find any bugs.
